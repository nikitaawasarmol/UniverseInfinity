            <h1>1. Raven Paradox</h1>
            </div>
        <div class="pr">
            <p>The raven paradox, also known as Hempel's paradox, Hempel's ravens, or rarely the 
        paradox of indoor ornithology, is a paradox arising from the question of what is 
        supposed to be evidence for a statement. Observing objects that are neither black nor
        ravens may formally increase the likelihood that all ravens are black even though, 
        these observations are unrelated.<br><br>
        The paradox is as follows - <br><br></p>
        </div>

        <div class="statement">
            <b><i>"(1) All ravens are black.<br>
        (2) If something is not black, then it is not a raven."</i></b></div><br>

        <div class="pr"><p>In all circumstances where (2) is true, (1) is also trueâ€”and likewise, in all 
        circumstances where (2) is false (i.e., if a world is imagined in which something that 
        was not black, yet was a raven, existed), (1) is also false. Given a general 
        statement such as all ravens are black, a form of the same statement that refers to 
        a specific observable instance of the general class would typically be considered to
        proving evidence for that general statement. Here the information is produced
        about raven by looking at any object which isn't a raven.</p>

        Bootstrap Paradox says that -</p>

        <b><i>"One day you find a book at your doorstep regarding how to build the time
        machine. You used that book and made a time machine after 10 years. Then you decided 
        to find the origin of the book. So using the time machine you travelled back 10 years
        to find the origin of the book. But instead you kept the book at the doorstep and 
        eventually gave it to the past YOU. So in this whole case the origin of the book is 
        unknown and yet it still exists but its now trapped in a time loop."</i></b></div><br><br>
        
        <div class="pr"><p> In this paradox we are dealing with the concept of time travel. As the statement says
        the origin of the book remains unclear. As you recieved the book from the future you.
        The future might have been recieved the book his future and so on. But now its stuck
        in a time loop. If you decided not to travel back in time and give the book to past
        YOU it'll create a paradox similar to grandfather paradox like if you didn't go to the
        past then you would never recieve the book. If you never recieved the book then you 
        never build the time machine and if you never build the time machine you would never
        go in past to give the book! Like that. The Netflix series <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_(TV_series)" target="_blank" id="link">Dark</a>
        is also based on the same paradox!</p></div>

            <p> Crocodile paradox, also known as crocodile sophism, is a paradox in logic in the 
        same family of paradoxes as the liar paradox.</p>

        <div class="statement">
           <h2> The Crocodile Paradox says that -</h2> <br>
        <b><i>"One day a crocodile abducts a kid. His mother request the crocodile to release
        the kid. Crocodile says "You have to tell what i am thinking about the release of child 
        that is am I thinking to release him or not.? If you guessed correctly I'll release 
        him." Here is the paradox.
        
        <ul>
            <li>If the Mother replies "Yes" to the question of crocodile and
        the crocodile was not thinking to release the kid then they both disagree and kid 
        would not be released</li><br>

        </ul></i></b></div>

        <div class="pr"><p>Here its all about the perception and how we understand the meaning of world. In 
        first case where the mother says Yes to the question, the crocodile may lie and say
        that he wasn't thinking to release him in order to create a disagreement and as per
        the terms he said he'll keep the kid.</p>
        <p>Whereas in the other case where the mother says No to the question the crocodile 
        may again lie but this time he'll take the answer of the mother as an Order rather 
        than as a statement. So regardless of what he's thinking he'll keep the kid
        irrespective of his terms.</p></div>

            <p>The twin earth paradox deals with the concept of Multiverse. Here's what it says -</p>

            <p>Twin Earth is a thought experiment proposed by philosopher <b> Hilary Putnam </b> in his

        meant to serve as an illustration of his argument for semantic externalism, or the 
        view that the meanings of words are not purely psychological. The Twin Earth thought 
        experiment was one of three examples that Putnam offered in support of semantic 
        externalism, the other two being what he called the Aluminum-Molybdenum case and the 
        Beech-Elm case. Since the publication of these cases, numerous variations on the 
        thought experiment have been proposed by philosophers.</p></div>
